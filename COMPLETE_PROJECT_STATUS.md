## 💡 **LAUNCH STRATEGY OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Launch NOW** ⭐ (Recommended)
**Timeline:** Today  
**What you have:** 29 features, segment organization, auth redesign  
**What's missing:** Payments (can add later)  
**Pros:** Get to market ASAP, gather real user feedback  
**Cons:** No revenue yet (but can monetize later)

### **Option B: Launch with Stripe**
**Timeline:** 3-4 days  
**What you have:** Everything + payment processing  
**What's missing:** API (business customers can wait)  
**Pros:** Revenue from day 1  
**Cons:** 3-4 day delay

### **Option C: Full-Featured Launch**
**Timeline:** 7-10 days

**Pros:** Complete platform  
**Cons:** 1-2 week delay

**My Recommendation:** **Option B** (Launch with Stripe in 3-4 days)
